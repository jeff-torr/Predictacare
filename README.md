## PredictaCare
PredictaCare is a project developed during the Philly Codefest, aimed at optimizing doctors' offices and hospitals' schedules through the utilization of machine learning algorithms. The core functionality of PredictaCare lies in its ability to estimate appointment length based on the patient's description, thus enabling more efficient scheduling practices and reducing waiting room times.

## How It Works
PredictaCare leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient descriptions, which may be entered by secretaries or staff members during appointment scheduling. By analyzing various factors such as the nature of the ailment, symptoms, and other relevant information provided by the patient, PredictaCare predicts the duration of the appointment.

## Key Features
Efficient Scheduling: By accurately estimating appointment lengths, PredictaCare helps in optimizing schedules for doctors and medical facilities, reducing idle time and maximizing productivity.
Reduced Waiting Room Times: With better scheduling practices, PredictaCare aims to minimize waiting room times for patients, improving overall patient experience and satisfaction.
Multifaceted Benefits: PredictaCare benefits both patients and care providers. Patients can compare appointment lengths and waiting times at different locations to make informed decisions about where to seek medical care.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: PredictaCare utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patient descriptions and predict appointment durations.
SkLearn is used for building and training machine learning models.
Python: The backend logic of PredictaCare is implemented in Python, leveraging its extensive libraries for machine learning and data processing.
Node.js and Docker: The project may involve deployment using Node.js and Docker for containerization.
How to Use
Currently, the project is under development and may not be available for general use. However, once completed, PredictaCare will be accessible through an intuitive user interface where users can input patient descriptions and receive estimated appointment lengths.

## Contributing
PredictaCare welcomes contributions from developers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals interested in improving scheduling practices and patient experiences in medical facilities. Contributions can include code contributions, feature suggestions, bug reports, and feedback.
